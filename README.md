# MotorDatabase
Welcome to **MotorDatabase** â€” a repository aimed at providing a **standardized CSV format** for UAV motor performance data. This database is designed to be both **human-readable** and **automation-friendly**, as it is aimed at UAV design and optimization.

## Overview
For many commercial and hobby UAV motors, manufacturers typically specify performance using static thrust data. However, this data is often highly **non-standardized**. Some manufacturers only provide **maximum thrust** and **KV ratings**. Others include more detailed parameters like **temperature**, **reaction torque**, and **efficiency**.

The lack of standardization can make comparing motors challenging. **MotorDatabase** addresses this issue by:
1. Providing a **consistent CSV format** for motor specifications.
2. Including scripts for **data processing** and **conversion**.
3. Hosting CSV files for a wide variety of motor brands.

## Features
- **Standardized Format**:
  - Ensures consistency across all motor data, following **formatGuidelines.md**.
  - Handles missing parameters gracefully.
- **Automation-Friendly**:
  - Easily integrates with data analysis pipelines.
- **Human-Readable**:
  - Clear organization for quick manual inspection.
- **Extensible**:
  - Allows inclusion of additional parameters as needed.

## Requirements and Setup
The main requirements to this project are python based.

Please ensure that python 3.12 is installed and then create a **venv** at the root of this repository using **requirements.txt**.

If you are on windows you can use **venv_help_windows.bat** to automatically set up the venv, assuming python 3.12 is installed.
