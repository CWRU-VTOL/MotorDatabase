# Format Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for naming conventions and CSV format specifications for the MotorDatabase project.

## Naming Convention for File Names

### Placeholder:
- Guidelines for naming files will go here.

## CSV Contents and Organization

### Placeholder:
- Under no cirumstances may any cell contain a comma, as that will break the csv file.
- Ideally the scripts will be robust so the important thing is only the column names and flat structure, and column order and data sorting is flexible. Will update if this flexibility is not implemented well.
